# Daily-Word

Uses a Excel spreadsheet as a database of translated words (can be any language) and displays them daily for words to learn in a new language with pronunciation. In this case we used English to Korean.

We used technical skills like Flask, openpyxl, and CSS to create the website.

Running Instructions: Currently to run the web application you must have all the files in the repository, then run app.py. Once you run it there will be a link                                 displaying our application. In the near future a server will host our work.
